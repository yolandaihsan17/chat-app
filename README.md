## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## NOTE
I intentionally leave the credentials into the file so you can test the application. i might delete it in 1 month.
To test it (chat with other user), you can login into another account using incognito mode or using other browser. so you have 2 account logged in.

To add other user id:
1. Click on your profile picture
2. Copy and paste your id into "add user" input
